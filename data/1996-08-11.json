The dark curly lanes visible in part of the constellation Ophiuchus belong to the Snake Nebula. The Snake Nebula is a series of dark absorption clouds.  Interstellar dust grains - composed predominantly of carbon - absorb visible starlight and reradiate much of it in the infrared. Infrared is a band of light so red humans can't see it.  This absorption causes stars in the background to be blocked from our view - and hence the appearance of noticeable voids on the sky.","title":"The Snake Nebula in Ophiuchus","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/snake_wp_big.gif"}
