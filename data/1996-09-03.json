The Pleiades can be seen without binoculars from even the depths of a light-polluted city.  Also known as the Seven Sisters and M45, the Pleiades is one of the brightest and most easily visible open clusters on the sky. The Pleiades contains over 3000 stars, is about 400 light years away, and only 13 light years across.
