Above, the Sun was captured by Skylab in\r 1973 throwing off one the largest eruptive prominences in recorded history.\r The Sun has\r survived for about 5 billion years, and will likely survive for\r another 5 billion. The Sun is not on fire,\r will never explode,\r and a solar flare will never destroy the Earth. The Sun\r continues to present many unanswered questions.\r For example: Why is the Sun's corona so hot?\r What causes the Sun's unusual magnetic field?\r Why does the Sun's center emit so few neutrinos?\r","title":"The Sun Erupts","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/sunflare_skylab4_big.jpg"}
