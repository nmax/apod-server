One reason is the great amount\r of jet activity at such a large distance from the Sun.\r In the above false-color image,\r no less than seven jets can be seen emanating from Hale-Bopp's\r coma. As a comet nears the Sun,\r it's surface warms causing jets of\r previously trapped gas and dust to stream away from the nucleus.\r Astronomers continue to study Comet Hale-Bopp's\r unusual jet activity\r and wonder how much about the early Solar System Hale-Bopp\r will teach them, and how bright Hale-Bopp will ultimately become.\r","title":"Seven Jets from Comet Hale-Bopp","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9611/halebopp1_eso_big.gif"}
