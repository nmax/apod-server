A typical place\r is an area of dense nebular gas common\r to arms in spiral galaxies. Sometimes,\r however, a burst of star formation can occur with unusual geometry.\r Nearby galaxy NGC 1317 shows such an unusual ring of star formation\r surrounding its barred nucleus. \r In the above image, older stars appear more red and are more evident\r in the leftmost photograph in visible light. The rightmost photograph\r taken by the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope\r is in ultraviolet and highlights\r stars which are younger and bluer and shows the starbirth ring.\r This unusual ring may be evidence of a gravitational encounter\r with another galaxy, causing a density wave\r to ripple out from the galaxy's center.\r","title":"Starburst Ring in Galaxy NGC 1317","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9612/ngc1317_uit_big.gif"}
