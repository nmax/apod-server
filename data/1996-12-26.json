Sagan\r was the world's most famous astronomer.  Among his many activities\r as a scientist, he contributed to the discovery that the atmosphere\r of Venus is prohibitively hot and\r dense, and found evidence that Saturn's\r moon Titan contains oceans stocked with the building blocks of life.\r Sagan\r was an outspoken proponent of the search for extra-terrestrial life,\r including sending probes to other planets and\r listening with large radio telescopes\r for signals from intelligent aliens. Sagan's\r outstanding ability to explain allowed almost a billion people\r to better understand the cosmos in which they live.","title":"Carl Sagan 1934-1996","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9612/sagan_uc_big.jpg"}
