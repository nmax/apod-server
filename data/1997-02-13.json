Here, background stars appear as faint raised streaks.\r Comet Hale-Bopp is currently brighter\r than most stars, and is visible in the morning sky.\r Comet Hale-Bopp\r will continue to brighten and develop an extended tail\r until April.","title":"More Jets from Comet Hale-Bopp","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9702/halebopp1_usno.jpg"}
