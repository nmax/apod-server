But the seemingly insignificant fuzzy patch shown above\r turned out to be part of a galaxy that is even closer. Deemed\r the \"Sagittarius Dwarf\",\r this small galaxy went unnoticed until its discovery in 1994 by\r R. Ibata, G. Gilmore and M. Irwin (RGO).\r The reason the Sagittarius Dwarf hadn't been discovered earlier\r is because it is so dim, it is so spread out over the sky, and\r there are so many Milky Way stars in front of it. The distance\r to the Sagittarius Dwarf\r was recently measured to be about one third of the distance to\r the LMC. Astronomers now believe that this galaxy is slowly being torn apart\r by the vast gravitational forces of our Galaxy. \r","title":"The Closest Galaxy: The Sagittarius Dwarf","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/Sagdwarf_not_big.gif"}
