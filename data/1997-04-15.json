Here the comet is pictured\r behind the array of radio telescopes\r which compose the Plateau de Bure Interferometer.\r These telescopes are being used to detect the presence of different molecules\r in the coma and tail of Comet Hale-Bopp. Molecules detected\r in the comet include carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. The\r abundance of different types of molecules in Comet Hale-Bopp's\r coma give clues to its composition\r and history, as well as clues to the composition and history of\r our Solar System. Comet Hale-Bopp\r has now rounded the Sun and is headed\r back out. It can still be seen by northern observers for several\r weeks in the northwest sky after sunset.\r","title":"Hale-Bopp and the Plateau de Bure Interferometer","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9704/halebopp1_iram.jpg"}
