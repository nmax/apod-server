The bright blue ion tail\r now shows several streams. Now receding\r from both the Sun and the Earth, Comet Hale-Bopp\r should still remain an impressive sight\r for weeks to come as it slowly fades.\r","title":"A Star Cluster Through Hale-Bopp's Tail","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9704/halebopp8_aac_big.jpg"}
