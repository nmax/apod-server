Jets of protons and electrons that shoot away from objects such as quasars and black holes appear to travel at speeds approaching this maximum speed, though.  Such jets carry tremendous energy and can ram straight through interstellar material. In the above frame from a computer simulation, a jet traveling only 98 percent of light speed rams and mixes with interstellar material.  Even higher energy jets might well explain the structure seen around Cygnus A.","title":"Jet Near Light Speed","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9711/cygjet2_umi_big.gif"}
