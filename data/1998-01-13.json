The large amount of warm water in the Pacific Ocean near the equator is causing unusual weather all over planet Earth.  The above false-color images of Earth show the relative levels of warm water between normal (upper left) and the comparatively mild El Niño of 1995 - 1996. Red indicates a high water level.  Detailed measurements of this years El Niño indicate the warm water level is rising and falling in rhythmic fashion, possibly in response to changing wind patterns.","title":"El Nino Water Rhythm","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9801/elnino4_jpl_big.jpg"}
