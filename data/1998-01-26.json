The above images show sunlight momentarily reflected from this spacecraft's solar panels.  No aliens were involved - the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission actually originated from Earth. Launched in 1996, NEAR zipped past the asteroid 253 Mathilde last June. This Earth flyby gravitationally deflects NEAR onto a trajectory passing the asteroid 433 Eros next year.  Above, NEAR appears to move through the constellation of Perseus, as  clouds created a changing diffuse white glow.  NEAR was only visible for about 2 minutes from San Jose, California, where these image-intensified video camera observations were taken.","title":"Interplanetary Spaceship Passes Earth","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9801/nearpass_pj.gif"}
