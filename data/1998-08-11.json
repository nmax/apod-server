The temperature of the gas is color coded so that blue represents hundreds of thousands of Kelvin, while red represents extreme temperatures in the millions of Kelvin.  Hot gas is channeled into lanes ordered by the Sun's chaotic magnetic field.  Pictures like these have shown that plasma heating occurs in relatively small regions.","title":"Sun Dance","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9808/activesun_trace_big.jpg"}
