Large cloud systems on Jupiter rotate, and the newly formed oval pictured above is no different.  This new oval formed earlier this year from the collision of two smaller ovals: an occurrence not unlike two large storms merging into one huge hurricane.  Even this new swirling storm, however, is small compared to Jupiter's Great Red Spot.  The above-animated frame dithers between two pictures of the new oval taken roughly an hour apart.  The Galileo spacecraft currently orbiting the giant Jovian planet captured the pictures.","title":"A New Jupiter Oval Rotates","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9901/jupovalrot_gal_big.gif"}
