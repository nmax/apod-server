Also known as the M17 and the Swan Nebula, the Omega Nebula is about 5000 light-years away, 20 light-years across, and  visible with binoculars in the constellation of Sagittarius. A recent epoch of star formation has created some very massive stars that haven't yet had time to self-destruct.  Until then, these stars appear very bright and emit light so energetic it breaks up the surrounding gas and dust.  The streaks across the bright stars are blemishes caused by the digital camera.","title":"M17: The Omega Nebula","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9901/omega_noao_big.jpg"}
