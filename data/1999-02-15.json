Cold water topping an unusually low sea level is shown as purple in the above false-color picture taken by the orbiting TOPEX/Poseidon satellite in mid-January.  Such cold water tends to deflect winds around it, changing the course of weather systems locally and the nature of weather patterns globally.  This year's La Ni単a appears to have weakened over the past few months, indicating a slow return to more normal seasonal weather.  The full effects of the preceding El Ni単o and the present La Ni単a are still under study.","title":"La Nina Earth","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9902/lanina2_topex_big.gif"}
