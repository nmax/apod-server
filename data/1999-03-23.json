Towards Chamaeleon, dark molecular clouds and bright planetary nebula NGC 3195 can be found.  Visible near the center of the above photograph is a reflection nebula surrounding a young bright star. On the lower right, a dark molecular cloud blocks the light from stars behind it.  It takes light hundreds of years to reach us from these objects.","title":"A Chamaeleon Sky","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9903/chamaeleon_vlt_big.jpg"}
