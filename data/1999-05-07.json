About 4,000 light-years from Earth, the stars at the left are young, massive, and energetic. Their intense ultraviolet radiation is eating away at the nearby star forming cloud complex - ionizing the hydrogen gas and producing the characteristic red \"hydrogen-alpha\" glow. At right, visible within the dark dust nebula, is small cluster of newborn stars. This beautiful color picture is a composite of images made through blue, green, and hydrogen-alpha filters.","title":"Hot Stars in the Southern Milky Way","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9905/rcw108_eso_big.jpg"}
