The Magellanic Clouds are small irregular galaxies orbiting our own larger Milky Way spiral galaxy.  The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), pictured here, is about 250,000 light years away and contains a preponderance of young, hot, blue stars indicating it has undergone a recent period of star formation.  There is evidence that the SMC is not gravitationally bound to the LMC.","title":"The Small Cloud of Magellan (SMC)","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0004/smc_uks.gif"}
