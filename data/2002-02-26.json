The jets emanating from NGC 5532 and are nearly a million light years long.  Exactly how the central black hole expels the infalling matter is still unknown.  After clearing the galaxy, however, the jets inflate large radio bubbles that could glow for millions of years.  If excited by a passing front, radio bubbles can even light up again after a billion years.  Visible light is depicted in the above image in blue, while radio waves are shown in red.  The radio map was created with the Very Large Array of radio telescopes.","title":"Jets from Radio Galaxy 3C296","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0202/3c296_nrao_big.jpg"}
