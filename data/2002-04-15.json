During the present visit of Space Shuttle Atlantis, astronauts are installing a huge truss on the growing space outpost.  The truss is over 13 meters long and about 4.5 meters wide.  Dubbed Starboard 0, or S0 (pronounced S-Zero) for short, the truss will route electricity, vent excess heat, and allow for future ISS expansion.
