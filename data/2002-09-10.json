Thick thunderclouds from a passing storm are the origin of a strong cloud to ground lightning strike.  Small areas of rain darken portions of the orange sunset, visible at the horizon above the vast prairie.  The planet Venus peeks below the clouds on the lower left of the image.  Blue sky shines high above the distant storm, streaked with high white cirrus clouds.  The bright star Arcturus glitters near the image top, just left of center.  Just a few minutes later, only a memory and this picture remained.","title":"Venus Beyond the Storm","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0209/venusstorms_anderson_big.jpg"}
