Last weekend, this huge Russian rocket was launched toward Earth-orbiting International Space Station (ISS), carrying two astronauts who will make up the new Expedition 7 crew.  Seen here during rollout at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the rocket's white top is actually a Soyuz TMA-2, the most recent version of the longest serving type of human spacecraft.  The base is a Russian R7 rocket, originally developed as a prototype Intercontinental Ballistic Missile in 1957.  The rocket spans the width of a football field and has a fueled mass of about half a million kilograms.  Russian rockets like this will be primary transportation system to the ISS while NASA studies the underlying reasons behind the recent tragic break-up of the Space Shuttle Columbia.","title":"Rollout of a Soyuz TMA 2 Rocket","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0304/tma2_nasa_big.jpg"}
