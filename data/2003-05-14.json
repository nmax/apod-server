The Magellan probe that orbited Venus from 1990 to 1994 was able to peer through the thick Venusian clouds and build up the above image by emitting and re-detecting cloud-penetrating radar.  Visible as the bright patch below central North is Venus' highest mountain Maxwell Montes.  Other notable features include numerous mountains, coronas, impact craters, tessera, ridges, and lava flows.
