It is part of a gathering of about 50 galaxies known as the Local Group.  Members include the Great Andromeda Galaxy (M31), M32, M33, the Large Magellanic Cloud, the Small Magellanic Cloud, Dwingeloo 1, several small irregular galaxies, and many dwarf elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.  Pictured above is the Aquarius Dwarf, a faint dwarf irregular galaxy over 3 million light years away.  An earlier APOD erroneously identified the above image as the Sagittarius Dwarf.","title":"APOD: 2003 July 27 -The Aquarius Dwarf","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0307/aqudwarf_not.gif"}
