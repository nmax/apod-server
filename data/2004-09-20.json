The Cassini spacecraft that recently entered orbit around Saturn has confirmed that some of Saturn's rings are more transparent than others.  Pictured above, Saturn's main A, B, and C rings can be seen, top to bottom, superposed against the gas giant planet.  Although the B-ring across the top is opaque, Saturn's cloud tops can be clearly seen through the lower C-ring.  The translucent nature of the C-ring likely indicates that it is less densely populated with ring particles than the B-ring.  The above image was taken on July 30 while Cassini was over 7 million kilometers from Saturn.","title":"Seeing Through Saturn's C Ring","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0409/Cring_cassini_big.jpg"}
