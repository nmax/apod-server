Known as Kemble's Cascade, the asterism contains about 20  stars nearly in a row stretching over five times the width of a full moon.  Made popular by astronomy enthusiast Lucian Kemble (1922-1999), these stars appear as a string only from our direction in the Milky Way Galaxy.  The above photograph of Kemble's Cascade was made with a small telescope in New Mexico, USA.  The bright object near the bottom left is the relatively compact open cluster of stars known as NGC 1502.","title":"Kembles Cascade","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0008/kemblescascade_macdonald_big.jpg"}
