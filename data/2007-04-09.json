Aurora rarely reach below 60 kilometers, and can range up to 1000 kilometers.  Aurora light results from solar shockwave causing energetic electrons and protons to striking molecules in the Earth's atmosphere.  Frequently, when viewed from space, a complete aurora will appear as a circle around one of the Earth's magnetic poles.
