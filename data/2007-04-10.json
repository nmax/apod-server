Visible in the distance are some of the many complex rings that orbit the Solar System's second largest planet.  In the foreground looms the gigantic world itself, covered with white dots that are clouds high in Saturn's thick atmosphere.   Saturn's atmosphere is so thick that only clouds are visible.  At the very South Pole of Saturn lies a huge vortex that is a hurricane-like storm showing no sign of dissipating.   The robotic Cassini spacecraft took the above image in January from about one million kilometers out, resolving details about 50 kilometers across.","title":"Saturn from Below","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0704/belowsaturn_cassini_big.jpg"}
