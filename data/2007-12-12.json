The rolling robot is trying to reach an outpost to spend the winter, but it keeps getting bogged down in soft sand on Mars. Earth scientists hope that Spirit can reach a slope on the northern edge of the unusual feature dubbed Home Plate, before the end of this month when northern winter will be phasing in on Mars.   Reaching this slope will likely allow the rover to tilt enough toward the Sun to create a needed increase in the efficiency of its energy-absorbing solar panels.  This map shows the path of Spirit from July 2004 until just last month.","title":"Mars Rover Races to Survive","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0712/spiritpath_hirise_big.jpg"}
