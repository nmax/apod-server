For starters, on this day in 2002, no intense auroral activity was expected at all.  Possibly more surprising, however, the aurora appeared to show an usual structure of green rays from some locations.  In this view, captured from North Dakota, USA, a picket fence of green rays stretches toward the horizon.  Mirroring the green rays is a red band, somewhat rare in its own right.  Lights from the cities of Bismarck and Mandan are visible near the horizon.    Note: A German language mirror of APOD is now available.","title":"Rays from an Unexpected Aurora","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0801/aurorarays_anderson_big.jpg"}
