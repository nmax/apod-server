Last Saturday, after driving the winding road up Uludag, a mountain near Bursa, Turkey, he was rewarded by this beautiful skyview to the south. Near the center, bright planet Jupiter outshines the city lights below and the stars of the constellation Sagittarius.

Uludag was known in ancient times as the Mysian Olympus.","title":"Milky Way Road Trip","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0809/uludag_tezel.jpg"}
