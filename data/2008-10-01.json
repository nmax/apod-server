Shown above, the Bumper V-2 was an ambitious two-stage rocket program that topped a V-2 missile base with a WAC Corporal rocket.  The upper stage was able to reach then-record altitudes of almost 400 kilometers, higher than even modern Space Shuttles fly today.  Launched under the direction of the  General Electric Company, the Bumper V-2 was used primarily for testing rocket systems and for research on the upper atmosphere.  Bumper V-2 rockets carried small payloads that allowed them to measure attributes including air temperature and cosmic ray impacts.  Seven years later, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I and Sputnik II, the first  satellites into Earth orbit.  In response in 1958, 50 years ago today, the US created NASA.","title":"The First Rocket Launch from Cape Canaveral","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0809/bumper2_nasa_big.jpg"}
