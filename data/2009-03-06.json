Separated by only about 2 degrees, they also were both in a crescent phase.  Just like our Moon, Venus can appear as a full disk or a thin crescent.  Frequently the brightest object in the post-sunset or pre-sunrise sky, Venus is so small that it usually requires binoculars or a small telescope to clearly see its phase.  This telescopic image of Friday's conjunction shows off the similar crescent phases, with the tiny crescent Venus at the upper right.","title":"Crescent Moon and Venus","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0903/crescentmoonvenus_sullivan_big.jpg"}
