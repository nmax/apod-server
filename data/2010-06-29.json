Earlier this month, over Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean, a playful photographer with an eye for the sky took eight images and composed the above intriguing picture.

The image, however, may be more than beautiful -- it may also be a scavenger hunt.

One remarkable feature of the above image is that its center contains the very center of our Milky Way Galaxy.","title":"Trees, Sky, Galactic Eye","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1006/galacticeye_perrot_big.jpg"}
