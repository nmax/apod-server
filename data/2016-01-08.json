But in modern times the name is given to a small moon of Saturn, orbiting just inside Saturn's F ring. In a complex interaction, the tiny potato-shaped moon interacts with the icy ring particles creating structures along the F ring still not fully understood. One of the highest resolution views of Prometheus, this image of its pocked surface posing with the thin F ring in the background was taken during the Cassini spacecraft's close approach on December 6, 2015. Prometheus is about 86 kilometers (50 miles) across.","hdurl":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1601/PIA17207prometheus.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Prometheus and the F Ring","url":"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1601/PIA17207prometheus1020.jpg"}
